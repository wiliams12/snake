This is a pygame impelmentation of the classic game.

The boxed mode is a mode where the border of the screen is also the in-game border

The classic mode is a mode where the moves from one side of the screen to the other when it reaches border. I am not sure whether it is called "the classic mode" but it is the game mode that I used to play the mode on my old Nokia.
